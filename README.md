# Memory Button Game

## Overview
The **Memory Button Game** is a simple JavaScript-based game where players need to memorize the sequence of buttons and then click them in the correct order after they are shuffled. The game is designed to test and challenge your memory skills. It uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, following object-oriented programming principles.

## How It Works
1. The user inputs the number of buttons (between 3 and 7).
2. Buttons are displayed in a row, and the user must memorize their order.
3. After a short pause (based on the number of buttons), the buttons are shuffled to random positions.
4. The button numbers are hidden, and the user must click the buttons in the correct order.
5. The game ends when the sequence is completed successfully or the wrong button is clicked.

## Features
- Button shuffling: Buttons move to random positions within the browser window.
- Memory challenge: Buttons are hidden after shuffling, and players must recall the sequence.
- Success and failure alerts: Players are notified if they complete the sequence correctly or if they click the wrong button.
- Input validation: Ensures that only valid input (3-7 buttons) is accepted.
- User-friendly messages guide the player throughout the game.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the game interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the game buttons and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, button creation, event handling, and user interaction.
